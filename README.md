![Babel Cover](images/babel_cover.png)

## Introduction
Babel AI is a Python-based project that delves into the fascinating realm of generating all conceivable images within specific parameters such as pixel size, color depth, and options for black and white or color. It features a user-friendly graphical interface to seamlessly visualize the generated images. Additionally, it empowers users to import existing images to ascertain their unique position within the comprehensive library of all potential images.

## Why call it Babel?
The Library of Babel is a famous short story by Jorge Luis Borges, published in 1941. It describes a universe in the form of a vast library containing all possible 410-page books that can be composed using a set of just a few characters (25 symbols: 22 letters, the period, the comma, and the space).

## Features
- Generate a myriad of images based on user-defined parameters like pixel size and color depth.
- Effortlessly navigate through the generated images using an intuitive slider and navigation buttons.
- Import and pinpoint the ID of existing images within the global image library.
- Exclude images resembling random noise beyond a set threshold to ensure quality and relevance.
- Employ advanced mathematical techniques to analyze and contrast images, unveiling underlying patterns and similarities.
- Save generated images to the user's computer or copy them to the clipboard for easy sharing.
- Customize the image resampling filter for enhanced visual quality.
- View the current image ID and position within the library of all possible images.

## Installation
